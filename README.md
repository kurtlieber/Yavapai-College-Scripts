# Yavapai-College-Scripts

These are mostly scripts that I've created to help better manage the lab environments for YC-related CNT courses.  Some are designed for the concurrent enrollment environments.  Others are designed for the YC environment.  

If you're unsure of what any of these do, ask.  These are mainly for my personal use, so not all of them have good comments, intros, etc.  Feel free to ask if you have any questions.
